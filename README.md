Requires Commerce 0.11 or higher.

## Configuration & Usage

_Docs to follow._

## Install as a package

_Installable package will be available from modmore.com._

## Building from source

To run the module from source, for example if you'd like to contribute a change, you'll need to take a few steps.

1. Clone the repository (or better yet, a clone of your own fork)

2. Copy config.core.sample.php to config.core.php, and if needed adjust it so that it includes your MODX site's config.core.php. Make sure you have [Commerce](https://www.modmore.com/commerce/) installed as well, of course.

3. From the browser open `_bootstrap/index.php`, this will set up the necessary settings and will make the module known to Commerce.

4. Enable the module under Configuration > Modules.
